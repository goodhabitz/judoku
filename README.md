# Judoku
## the judo of sudoku

A highly-optimised puzzle generator and solver. On my 5-year old Macbook Air, average time to solve a puzzle is 88 Âµs.

This started out as a project to test some ideas around JVM optimisations for low-latency banking applications, but turned into a chance to explore what's been happening internally inside the JVM with its evolution and re-think my optimisation strategies. The JVM, for example, has very much been optimised for immutable objects and ultra-fast heap allocation.

Time to brute-force recursively solve puzzles started out at 21 ms. Applying different optimisation strategies, some with scale factors of improvement reduced this ultimately by 99.6%.

Anyhow, this library produces beautiful sudoku grids and solves given puzzles fast. It supports arbitrary sizes,
like 4x4 or 16x16, in addition to the normal 9x9. The sub-boxes don't even need to be square; you can have a 6x6 made up of 3x2 boxes if you like:

Or, how about this beauty?

I wrote some articles on what I discovered. It's a series looking at the JVM, sudoku strategies, some Kotlin coding techniques:
