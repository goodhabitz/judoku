- Switch to Apache license
- amalgamate jd* progs into judoku [-solve | -gen | -view ]
- better way to generate is do it as a solve(), keeping track of the path on the way to the leaf and then unrolling it

- GSON should be lazyint instead of un thread safe nullable
- "RANDOM" should be processed outside of the Symmetry class
- make jar a fat jar so gson doesn't need to be in the CP
